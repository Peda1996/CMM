    <h1>Error while reading the library</h1>
    <h2>What happened?</h2>
    <p>
        A library which you would use cannot readed. A library is a file, which can be included with the command <strong id="code">#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</strong>.
    </p>
    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
    <p>
        Check the the files inside the directory "clib" and user specific librarys. Probably the file is not readable or the program doesn't has read access to that file.<br/>
