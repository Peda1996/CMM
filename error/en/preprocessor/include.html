    <h1>library not found</h1>
    <h2>What happened?</h2>
    <p>
        A library which you would use is not found. A library is a file, which can be included with the command <strong id="code">#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</strong>.
    </p>
    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
    <p>
        Standard libraries containing many function, which you know from C, and they can be included using the following way:
        <div class="code">
            #include
            <strong class = "error">&lt;</strong>
            stdlib.h
            <strong class = "error">&gt;</strong>
        </div>
        Watch out for typing errors. The following librarys are implemented yet:
        <ul>
            <li>stdlib.h</li>
            <li>stdio.h</li>
            <li>math.h</li>
        </ul>
    </p><br>
    <h2>Importing own libraries</h2>
    <p>
        If you include own librarys, you have to note that it is located inside the same directory as your .cmm file. Furthermore the syntax differs a little bit:
        <div class="code">
            #include
            <strong class = "error">"</strong>
            yourlibrary.h
            <strong class = "error">"</strong>
        </div>
    </p>
</body>
