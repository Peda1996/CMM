    <h1>forward declaration without function declaration</h1>
    <h2>What happened?</h2>
    <p>
        There is a forward declaration of a function, but the function itself is not declared.
    </p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p class="code">
        <strong class="key">int</strong> foo();<br/>
        ...
    </p>
    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
    <p>
        Look on the forward declaration, and declare that function, or delete the forward declaration.
