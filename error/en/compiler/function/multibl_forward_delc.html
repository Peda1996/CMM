    <h1>Forward declaration already declared</h1>
    <h2>What happened?</h2>
    <p>
        You have done the forward delcaration of a function multible times.
    </p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p class="code">
        <strong class="key">void</strong> foo();<br/>
        ...<br/>
        <strong class="error">void foo();</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
    <p>
        Look on previous forward declarations and delete redundant declarations.<br/>
        Please notice that the forward declaration has to be before the first call of the function.
